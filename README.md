# Update
I am adding all functions in one file so you can just copy and paste it in TamperMonkey extension, 
and easily use them from now on, copy paste once - use forever



# JS4hacking
Set of scripts that will be useful for bug hunters

Using is easier than ever just navigate to `data:,` as google needs 'TrustedHTML' to execute our script

then import our code, and run the code in console


# Scripts
Scripts and their descriptions read down below

1) easyLoopLimiter() - can be used for bruteforcing or any kind of set of other actions that needs exact time to wait, easy to use, create you function and pass it as 4th parameter in string format
2) Shuffler() - string shuffler, you can generate all possible combinations of certain string, easy to use, and it will download the file automatically
3) 3rd will be coming up next!
