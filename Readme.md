# 🔥 JS4Hacking Extension — Now as a Chrome Addon!

![Demopic](https://github.com/Sevada797/JS4hacking/blob/main/assets/J4.png?raw=true)

I'm turning this **wonderful set of tools** into a **full Chrome Extension** — now it’s even easier to use.  
No more messy `data:,` tricks or manual script pasting. Just toggle and hack.

> 📦 Import once — use forever.

## 🧠 What is JS4Hacking?
A collection of JavaScript tools tailored for **bug bounty hunters**, **pentesters**, and anyone digging deep into web apps.

Previously, you had to inject it manually or use TamperMonkey — now it lives in your **browser toolbar**, always ready to go.

So simply said, any webpage you visit, script tag is injected(then removed) to import list of functions.

**J4 Modules had upadte !!**
### What are J4 Modules
I was thinkng of something that during manual pentesting can help, without calling anything,
and I came up with this idea, current Modules-pack is called **Reflection Hunter**

However in future I may add other features, and eventually create new Modules-pack
