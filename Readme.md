# 🔥 JS4Hacking Extension — Now as a Chrome Addon!

I'm turning this **wonderful set of tools** into a **full Chrome Extension** — now it’s even easier to use.  
No more messy `data:,` tricks or manual script pasting. Just toggle and hack.

> 📦 Import once — use forever.

## 🧠 What is JS4Hacking?
A collection of JavaScript tools tailored for **bug bounty hunters**, **pentesters**, and anyone digging deep into web apps.

Previously, you had to inject it manually or use TamperMonkey — now it lives in your **browser toolbar**, always ready to go.

## 🆕 What's New?
- ✅ Chrome extension interface
- ✅ Easy ON/OFF toggle for quick activation
- ✅ One-click script injection
- ✅ Cleaner, persistent setup

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right)

5. Boom! Now hit any target site, open DevTools(console), and use the extension!
